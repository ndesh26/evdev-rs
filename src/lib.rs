//! Rust bindings to libevdev, an wrapper for evdev devices.
//!
//! This library intends to provide a safe interface to the libevdev library. It
//! will look for the library on the local system, and link to the installed copy.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## Intializing a evdev device
//!
//! ```
//! use evdev_rs::Device;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! let f = File::open("/dev/input/event0").unwrap();
//!
//! let mut d = Device::new().unwrap();
//! d.set_fd(&f).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Getting the next event
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! use evdev_rs::Device;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! let f = File::open("/dev/input/event0").unwrap();
//!
//! let mut d = Device::new().unwrap();
//! d.set_fd(&f).unwrap();
//!
//! loop {
//!     let a = d.next_event(evdev_rs::NORMAL | evdev_rs::BLOCKING);
//!     match a {
//!         Ok(k) => println!("Event: time {}.{}, ++++++++++++++++++++ {} +++++++++++++++",
//!				              k.1.time.tv_sec,
//!				              k.1.time.tv_usec,
//!				              k.1.event_type),
//!         Err(e) => (),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
