A Rust wrapper for libevdev

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
evdev-rs = "0.6.2"
```

to enable serialization support, enable the feature "serde"
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
evdev-rs = { version = "0.6.2", features = ["serde"] }
```

With a newer libevdev version (>= 1.10) enable the feature `libevdev-1-10` to
allow disabling a property. It also extends the `Enable` trait to `InputProp`,
enabling the use of `enable()`, `disable()` and `has()` for `InputProp` as well.

Why a libevdev wrapper?
-----------------------
The evdev protocol is simple, but quirky, with a couple of behaviors that
are non-obvious. libevdev transparently handles some of those quirks.

The [evdev](https://github.com/emberian/evdev) crate is an implementation
of libevdev in Rust which provides most of the same features.

`evdev-rs` crate closely follows libevdev and hence enjoys all the complex handling
that libevdev does. Some of the things that libevdev handles transparently, which may or
may not be in `evdev` crate:

* handling of fake multitouch devices
* synching of slots and per-slot state
* transparent generation of missing tracking ids after SYN_DROPPED
* various boundary checks with defined error codes if you request invalid data
  (e.g. event codes that don't exist on the device)
* fd swapping on the same context
* disabling/enabling events on a per-context basis, so you can disable/enable ABS_FOO
  and then not care about quirks in the client-side code.

Development
-----------

`src/enums.rs` can be generated by running `./tools/make-enums.sh`.
